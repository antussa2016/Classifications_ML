<h2>What is classification?</h2>
<p>Classification is a machine learning task that involves categorizing or classifying data into predefined classes or categories. The goal of classification is to learn patterns from labeled training data and then apply those patterns to new, unlabeled data to predict their corresponding classes.</p>

<h2>Common types of classification algorithms:</h2>

<h3>Binary Classification:</h3> Data is classified into two classes or categories.
<h3>Multiclass Classification:</h3> Data is classified into more than two classes.
<h3>Multilabel Classification:</h3> Instances are associated with multiple labels or categories.
<h3>Imbalanced Classification:</h3> Dealing with datasets where the distribution of classes is highly skewed.
<h3>Hierarchical Classification:</h3> Organizing classes into a hierarchical structure.
<h3>Multioutput Classification:</h3> Predicting multiple target variables.
<h3>Ensemble Classification:</h3> Combining multiple models to improve accuracy.
<h3>One-vs-All (OvA) Classification:</h3> Breaking a multiclass problem into multiple binary classification subproblems.
<h3>One-vs-One (OvO) Classification:</h3> Building binary classifiers for each pair of classes.
